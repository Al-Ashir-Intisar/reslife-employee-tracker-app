# Employee Info Tracker Web App

This repository contains the codebase for a web application designed to track employee information that may not be part of an institution’s official records, but is highly valuable for short-term projects, group collaborations, and internal task assignments.

## Purpose

The app enables teams to quickly reference and manage data about employees such as:

- Certifications
- Skills and expertise
- Project history
- Availability
- Any custom metadata relevant to internal team workflows

This system is especially useful in dynamic environments where quick access to detailed employee info helps optimize task delegation and project planning.

## Features (Planned / In Development)

- ✅ Single Page Application (SPA) using Next.js
- ✅ Secure login and user authentication
- 🛠️ Admin and team-level views
- 🛠️ Role-based access control
- 🛠️ CSV/Excel import for bulk employee data
- 🛠️ Custom tags and categories for filtering

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React)
- **Backend**: Node.js / API Routes
- **Database**: TBD (PostgreSQL or Firebase)
- **Deployment**: Vercel / Docker (Planned)
