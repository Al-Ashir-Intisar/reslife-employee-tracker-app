# Employee Info Tracker Web App

This repository contains the codebase for a web application designed to track employee information that may not be part of an institution’s official records, but is highly valuable for short-term projects, group collaborations, and internal task assignments.

## Purpose

The app enables teams to quickly reference and manage data about employees such as:

- Certifications
- Skills and expertise
- Project history
- Task assignments
- Any custom metadata relevant to internal team workflows
- Time keeping for work hours instead of Sling that does not require location tracking but requires duration and recording time.

This system is especially useful in dynamic environments where quick access to detailed employee info helps optimize task delegation and project planning.

## Features (Planned / In Development)

- ✅ Single Page Application (SPA) using Next.js
- ✅ Secure login and user authentication
- 🛠️ Admin and team-level views
- 🛠️ Role-based access control
- 🛠️ Custom group overview dashboard

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React)
- **Backend**: Node.js / API Routes
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Deployment**: TBD (Vercel / Docker)
