# Employee Info Tracker Web App

This repository contains the codebase for a web application designed to track employee information that may not be part of an institution‚Äôs official records, but is highly valuable for short-term projects, group collaborations, and internal task assignments.

## Purpose

The app enables teams to quickly reference and manage data about employees such as:

- Certifications
- Skills and expertise
- Project history
- Task assignments
